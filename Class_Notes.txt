		- Requirement Analysis 		
	
		- Designg & Document 
		
		- Code & Development 		
		
		- Testing 
		
		- Implement to Prod with proper manual approvals
		
		- Monitor/Maintain
		
		
	Using AGILE Methodologies:
	
	 - We can Achieve :
	 
		- Continuous Development
		- Continuous Integration 
		- Continuous Testing 
		- Continuous Delivery
			- Used to perform Production release with manual approvals.
		
	 - We cannot Achieve :
	 
		- Continuous Deployment 	
			- Used to perform Production release without any manual approvals.
			
			
	- What is DevOps ???
	
	- DevOps :::::
	
		DevOps is a Software Development Strategy, which helps to promote the collaboration between the teams like Development Team and Operations Team to achieve Continuous Development, Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment and Continuous Monitoring in more Automated Fashion.
		
			Continuous Delivery & Deployment:
			
				- Both Continuous Delivery & Continuous Deployment are used to release the changes from Non-Prod to Prod.
				
				Continuous Delivery:
				
					- Continuous Delivery Exepects Manual Approvals
					- We might experience the Application Down-time
	
					Eg: 
				
					Banking Domain :
					
						Online Banking / Credit Card Transaction
				
							Create a Production Release Window:
								4 - 6Hrs 
								
	
				Continuous Deployment:
				
					- Never Exepects Manual Approvals	
					- Deploy the changes to production without any down-time.

					Eg:
					
					- Amazon/Netflix/Facebook/Google ::
					
						
				
	
					
	- How to Implement DevOps :::
	
		- Identify the Teams involved in the process of SDLC :
		
			- DevOps Team 
				- Infra-Structure Management Team 
				- Application Development Team
				- Testing Team 
				- Release Management Team 
				- Production Support Team 
				- Production Monitoring Team 
				- IT Security 
				
				
		- Environments :
		
			Non-Prod 									Prod Environments
			
				Dev Environment
				
				Test Environment
				
					QA 
					
					UAT 			================>		Production Servers - 1,2,3,4,5
	
		
		
		- Application Architecture :
		
			- Monolith Application Architecture:
			
				- It Tightly-Coupled Application Architecture
				- All the dependencies are tightly coupled 
				- With the we can achieve only Continuous Delivery.
				- We cannot achieve Continuous Deployment
			
			
			- Micro-Service Based Application Architecture: 
			
				- It is Loose-Coupled Application Architecture,
				- Each and every function is considered as Micro-Service.
				- With this we can achieve Continuous Deployment.

	Developer's Workload :
	
		Types of Projects:

			- Enhancement/Bugfix 
			- New Project 
			
	
	Git Cli Commands :
	
	
	git --version
	
	
	git clone 		:	To Clone/Copy the entire Remote Repository to Local Machine 
	
	git add 		:	To add the changes from Working Directory to Staging_Area
	
	git commit 		:	To commit the changes from Staging_Area to Local Repository
	
	git push 		:	To Push the Changes from Local Repository to Remote Repository
	
	git pull/Fetch 
		
		- Both git pull & git fetch are used to handle the incremental changes from Remote Repository
		
		- git Fetch :	
			To just check the incremental changes from remote repository. If any incremental changes exist, it will update the incremental changes only in the Local Repository. Not in the Working Directory.

		- git pull 	:
			Check the incremental changes from remote repository. If any incremental changes exist, it will update the incremental changes in the Local Repository as well in the Working Directory.

			As a best practise, always it is recommended to use git pull to keep the local repo in-sync with remote repository

				git pull = git fetch + git merge!
	
	git init 		:	To initialize a local git repository
						It will create a .git directory in the project workspace
						It will create a default branch called master/main
			
			
	Fork 			: 	To copy/backup a entire remote repository to another remote repository



	Work with Cli Commands :::
	
	Organize the WorkSpace :::
	
		cd d:

		mkdir MLProjects 
		
		cd MLProjects
		
		mkdir MLRepo1			# Workspace 
		
		mkdir MLRepo2

	Working_Directory 			Staging_Area 				Local_Repositor
	
	 file1.txt	 --------------> file1.txt --------------> file1.txt
					git add					git commit				
	
	
	
	git status			:	To Get the status of repository

	

	Git Configuration ::::
	
		As a best practise, using git global config to setup the user name and email after initializing the first local repository.
		
		Global Configuration:				# Applicable to all the Repositories
		
			git config --global user.name "LoksaiETA"
			
			git config --global user.email "loksai@asdf.com"

			git config --global --list
		
		Local Configuration:				# Applicable to a specific Repository
	
			git config user.name "LoksaiETA"
			
			git config user.email "loksai@asdf.com"	
			
			git config --list 
		
		
	git add ::::	
	
		git add file1.txt 

		git add file1.txt file2.txt
		
		git add *.doc 
		
		git add .							# . to select all files 
		


	git rm --cached 'file1.txt' 			# Unstage a file, the file changes will be back to working directory.
	
	git rm -f 'file1.txt' 					# Permantly Unstage and a delete a file from working directory.

	git reset :::
	
		git reset is used to undo the changes from the repository
		git reset will reset the commit point to the previous commit point 
		git reset will not create any new commit point for track purpose 
		git reset is not recommended in the shared repository 
	
		Syntax :		
			- git reset <reset_option> <previous_Commit_ID>
			
		Reset Options ::
		
			git reset --soft <previous_Commit_ID> :::
				- git reset will reset the HEAD pointer to the previous commit point.
				- It will take the changes back to staging area 
				- The Changes will be available in staging area and working directory					
		
			git reset --mixed <previous_Commit_ID> :::		# Default
				- git reset will reset the HEAD pointer to the previous commit point.
				- It will take the changes back to working directory 
				- The Changes will be available only in working directory			
			
			git reset --hard  <previous_Commit_ID> :::
				- git reset will reset the HEAD pointer to the previous commit point.
				- It will permanently delete the files from the system 
			
		
	ML Projects ::::
	
		Dataset  Source :
		
		
		ETL Process ::: 
		
			Extract 		==> 	for 30 mins  --> Raw Data ==> commited to a repository
			
			Transform 		==> 	Application Program to Process Data 	
			
			Load 			==> 	Saved to a Database 
			
							==>		Reset --hard pointing to initial commit (.gitignore)
							
	
	Git Revert :::
	
	git revert :::
	
		- Git Revert is same as git reset --hard option 		
		- git revert is used to undo a specific commit 		
		- git revert will create a new commit point for tracking purpose.		
		- git revert will maintain the commit history		
		- git revert is recommended in shared repositories
		
		Syntax ::
			git revert <specific_Commit_ID>		
			
	
	GIT Commit :::
	
	 - git commit 					# To Commit the changes from staging area to local repository	


			git commit -m "<Valid Commit_Message>"
			
			As a best practise :
			
			git commit -m "CR1001 - Message"
		
			git commit -m "REL-0126 - Payment Module updated"
							
							
	Git Branches ::::
	
		-> Git Branches are the logical copy of the Repository/Default Branch 
		
		-> Used to perform parallel development 
		
	
	Git Branching Strategies :::
	
		-> default branch - (master/main) ==> Used to maintain the production version of source.
		
		-> Git Branching Strategeies are used to maintain the integrity of the main/master Branch(Prod version)

		- How to fix Merge Conflicts ?
		
			- Identify the file(s) causing the merge conflicts
			- Open the file and review the changes 
			- Upon review, decide which changes to be retained/delete from that file(s).
			- Update the file by removing the extra header/footer notes and contents.
			- Perform git add and git commit to fix the issue.
	
	On DevOps Perspective :

		- On DevOps Perspective, We never fix the Merge Conflict. Instead, we Prevent Merge Conflict.!
		
	
	GIT :::
		
GIT Rebase : 

		- Rebase is used to maintain linear commit history 
		- Rebase is used to keep the current branch in-sync with target branch 
		- Rebase can prevent merge-conflicts in the target branch 
		- As a best practise, it is always recommended to use rebase before merge
		
	Repo  :

		master : cm1,cm2,cm3 
					
					cm1,cm2,cm3,f1cm1,f1cm2,f1cm3 				# Upon Merging feature1 
					
					
					cm1,cm2,cm3,f2cm1,f2cm2,f2cm3,f1cm1,f1cm2,f1cm3		# Upon Merging feature2 without proper rebase
					
					cm1,cm2,cm3,f1cm1,f1cm2,f1cm3,f2cm1,f2cm2,f2cm3		# Expected Commit History! using rebase!
		
		
			feature1 : cm1,cm2,cm3 
			
						cm1,cm2,cm3,f1cm1,f1cm2,f1cm3 
						
						git switch master 
						
						git merge feature1 
						
			
			feature2 : cm1,cm2,cm3 
				
						cm1,cm2,cm3,f2cm1,f2cm2,f2cm3 
						
						git rebase master 
						
						cm1,cm2,cm3,f1cm1,f1cm2,f1cm3,f2cm1,f2cm2,f2cm3
						
						
						git switch master 
						
						git merge feature2		
		
		
	- merge 
	
	- rebase 	--> Within the Repo. between the branches 
	
	- pull 		--> Used between the Remote & Local 
		
		

	- GIT SQUASH :::
	
		- It is a merge Option. Is used to combine more than one commits into single commit point.
		
		
		Repo1: 
		
			master: cm1,cm2 
			
						cm1,cm2,f1cm1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,................f1cm100   # Upon Merge without squash option

						cm1,cm2,cm3 					# Cm3 is combined changes from feature1
			
				feature1 : cm1,cm2 
				
							cm1,cm2,f1cm1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,................f1cm100
							
							
					git switch master 
					
					# git merge feature1 
					
					git merge --squash feature1 
			
					git commit -m "Combined Commit from feature1"
	

	- GIT STASH :::
	
		- Used to save the uncommited changes to a temporary area.
		
		
	git stash save "save_message"	# Save an entry in stash list
	
	git stash list 					# Get the Stash list.
	
	git stash apply 				# To apply the latest entry from the stash list back to staging area. 	
	git stash apply stash@{2}		# To apply a specific entry from the stash list back to staging area
	
	git stash drop 					# To delete the latest entry from the stash list.
	git stash drop stash@{2}		# To delete a specific entry from the stash list.
	
	git stash pop 					
		# To apply the latest entry from the stash list back to staging area as well as delete that latest entry from the stash list.								
									
	git stash pop stash@{1}	
		# To apply a specific entry from the stash list back to staging area as well as delete that specific entry from the stash list.
									
	git stash clear 				# To clean-up the stash list 
		
	
		
	GitHub Remote Repository Management :::
	
		- Create Remote GitHub Repositories:
		
		- Create Branches in Github Repositories
		
		- Merge the changes to target branch -- using pull request 
		
	
	Developers' Workload :
	
		--> Enhancement/Bugfix 
		
		--> New Project 
		
		

	git clone 		:	To Clone/Copy the entire Remote Repository to Local Machine 
	
	git add 		:	To add the changes from Working Directory to Staging_Area
	
	git commit 		:	To commit the changes from Staging_Area to Local Repository
	
	git push 		:	To Push the Changes from Local Repository to Remote Repository
	
	git pull/Fetch 
		
		- Both git pull & git fetch are used to handle the incremental changes from Remote Repository
		
		- git Fetch :	
			To just check the incremental changes from remote repository. If any incremental changes exist, it will update the incremental changes only in the Local Repository. Not in the Working Directory.

		- git pull 	:
			Check the incremental changes from remote repository. If any incremental changes exist, it will update the incremental changes in the Local Repository as well in the Working Directory.

			As a best practise, always it is recommended to use git pull to keep the local repo in-sync with remote repository

				git pull = git fetch + git merge!
	



	GIT Clone :::
	
		- git clone https://github.com/Edu-MLOps-BA1125/TestRepo1.git

	
		- git remote -v		# To get the list of remote repositories linked to a local repository
